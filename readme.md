# Notes for Instructor
This application allows sending timeframes to the team for each teammate to select convenient time to complete an activity. Useful if there are QA or other activities that need to be complete by individuals but you want to reserve time on their calendars ahead of time, and if there is a certain deadline or timeframe by when it needs to be started and complete.

All the CRUD operations are done in the Team editor <http://p4.idreamcode.me/team>

Please note, that I still need to complete the email and calendar sends, since it is not requirement for the project I'll complete it at a later time. Right now emails can be previewed when you click "Send Now".
