# Notes for Instructor
This application allows sending timeframes to the team for each member to select the most convenient time to complete an activity. We schedule all the QA activities at work, and it would be nice for the team to select their own times, and for the calendar invites to be created programmatically.

All the CRUD operations are done in the Team editor <http://p4.idreamcode.me/team>

Please note, that I still need to complete the email and calendar sends, since it is not requirement for the project I'll complete it at a later time.
